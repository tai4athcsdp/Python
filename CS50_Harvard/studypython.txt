1. Calling an API
	1.1 What is a web service
		- When a developer wants to share the functionality of a funcion but not the
		actual code in the program, they can place the function on a web server
		- A programer with the address of that function on the web server and the
		required permissions can call the function
		- this is called a web service
	1.2 What is an API
		- When you create a web service, you create an API
		- The API defines the function name and parameters so other know how
		to call your function
	1.3 Keys
		- Track which users have permission to use my web service
		- A developer signs up on my web service, or buys a license for
		my software and is provided a unique key
		- When the developer call my web service, they provide their unique key
		and i am albe to verify the key has been approved for calls to my web service
	1.4 There is a standart for sending messages across the web
		- HTTP is standart protocol for sending messages across the web
		- GET: 
			+ pass value in query string only
			+ special characters must be "escaped"
			+ limited amount of data
		- POST
			+ pass value in query string and body
			+ no need to escape special characters if passed in body
			+ can pass large amounts of data, including images, in body
	1.5 Request library 
		- simplifies http calls from python code
		- requests.post(address, http_headers, function_param, message body)
	1.6 Learning how to call  unlocks functionality from developers
	and sofware companies around the world
	
2. Python unit test
	-pytest is a third_party library that allows you to unit test your program
	- install pytest: pip install pytest
	- Organizing test into  of test with a single command
		- mkdir test
		- code test/test_hello.py
		- code test/__init__.py
		- pytest testfolder
		- run a whole folder
		- https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/explanation/pythonpath.html?highlight=folder#pytest-import-mechanisms-and-sys-path-pythonpath
